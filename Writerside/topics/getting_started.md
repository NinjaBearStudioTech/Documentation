Welcome to the **Ninja Bear Studio Plugins** documentation site! 

Here you will find detailed documentation for all Ninja Bear Studio tech, for the plugins that are currently available
for the Unreal Engine, or are currently a work in progress.

## Acquiring Licenses
Plugins can be obtained from **[Fab](https://www.fab.com/sellers/Ninja%20Bear%20Studio)**.
Once purchased, all plugins can be installed from the **Epic Games Launcher**, for any supported engine version.

## Getting Started
If you are using these plugins for the first time and might require support, it is **highly recommended** to start with
one of the Unreal Templates, and that you do not try to integrate them with third party plugins. That would facilitate
getting help from the support server, since you may be asked to provide a sample of any issues you may find.

The following list represents the recommended order to have them configured in your project.

1. Ninja Input: Additional functionality for handling player input, including GAS activation.
2. Ninja G.A.S.: Setup of the Gameplay Ability System for Players and AI.
3. Ninja Combat: Combat features built with GAS.
4. Ninja Inventory: Inventory functionality built with GAS.
5. Ninja Factions: AI team management.
6. Ninja Bot: AI Perception, behavior and strategy.

## Support Server
If you need support, please reach out via **e-mail** or access the **Discord server**. You can find the contact 
information in the **Plugin Card** for all plugins, inside **Unreal Engine**.
