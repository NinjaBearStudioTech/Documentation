## Equipment Instances

When an eligible item is added to an Equipment Container, the **Equipment Manager** automatically creates an `NinjaInventoryEquipment` 
instance to represent its presence in the world. These instances are tracked and updated based on the item's state and container configuration.

Equipment Instances are used to drive the **physical presence** of an item - either for visuals, gameplay, or both. 
Equipment can be represented in two main ways:

- **Actor**: For complex interactions, behaviors and multi-mesh representations.
- **Mesh**: For simpler visual representation (static or skeletal mesh).

The chosen type is defined per **Equipment State**, allowing different representations depending on the item's current 
usage. For example: a weapon might be an Actor, with a skeletal mesh and dedicated animation while equipped, but a simple
static mesh while stored.

### Equipment Actors

When using actors for equipment:

- There are no requirements on actor hierarchy (base classes or interfaces).
- The actor must include a `NinjaEquipmentActorComponent`.

This component receives a reference to the `UNinjaInventoryEquipment` instance that spawned it and provides support functions  
to access the **owning equipment and item**, the **equipment manager** and the **inventory manager*.

### Custom Equipment Logic

You can subclass `NinjaInventoryEquipment` to implement custom logic and assign your subclass directly to the [**Equipment Fragment**](inv_fragment_equipment.md). 
This enables additional gameplay systems, data storage, and access to custom behavior per equipment instance.

## Equipment States

Equipment States define how each `NinjaInventoryEquipment` is represented in the world, based on the item's current 
equipment **state tag**.

These are configured in the **Equipment Fragment** and mapped using one or more `FGameplayTag`s. Not all equipment states 
need to be represented visually - only those listed in the fragment will be created.

> **Performance Note**  
> 
> Equipment assets (such as actors or meshes) **shared** between states are reused and not recreated.

Each `InventoryEquipmentState` provides detailed control over how the item should appear or behave in a specific state.

| Property                         | Description                                                                                                |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `EquipmentStateTags`             | All equipment state tags covered by this configuration. Multiple tags can share the same settings.         |
| `EquipmentType`                  | Determines if this state uses an `Actor`, `StaticMesh`, or `SkeletalMesh`.                                 |
| `ActorClass`                     | Actor class to spawn for this state (if type is `Actor`).                                                  |
| `StaticMesh`                     | Static mesh to display for this state (if type is `StaticMesh`).                                           |
| `SkeletalMesh`                   | Skeletal mesh to display for this state (if type is `SkeletalMesh`).                                       |
| `bFollowsParentMesh`             | Whether the skeletal mesh should follow the parent avatarâ€™s mesh as a follower (leader pose).              |
| `SkeletalMeshAnimClass`          | Animation blueprint to use if the skeletal mesh is not using a leader pose.                                |
| `bOverridesParentFinderStrategy` | If true, overrides the default Attach Parent Finder.                                                       |
| `AttachParentFinderClass`        | Custom `NinjaEquipmentAttachParentFinder` used to determine the parent component for attachments.          |
| `bOverrideContainerSocket`       | Whether to override the socket defined in the Equipment Container.                                         |
| `AttachSocketName`               | Name of the socket to use when attaching the actor or mesh.                                                |
| `EquipmentAnimLayerClass`        | [Linked Animation Graph][1] add as a layer to the avatar's Animation Blueprint, while the state is active. |
| `AttributeSets`                  | Attribute sets granted to the avatar while in this equipment state.                                        |
| `GameplayEffects`                | Gameplay Effects applied to the avatar when entering this state.                                           |
| `Containers`                     | Additional containers granted while this state is active (e.g., ammo pouches or sheath slots).             |

> **Granting Gameplay Abilities**
>
> You can grant multiple abilities by using the **"Grant Gameplay Abilities"** Gameplay Effect Component, and then 
> applying that Gameplay Effect in a specific Equipment State.
>
> The **Gameplay Effect's level** is used in the Data Table mapping, allowing you to **set or transfer the Ability level** 
> based on the level at which the Gameplay Effect is applied, which can also be the **Item Level** itself!

## Changing States

The Inventory System provides the following options so you can change equipment state:

- **[](inv_fragment_equipment.md)**: Provides the `SetEquipmentState` function that can be used to update the item's equipment state.
- **[](inv_ability_equip.md)**: Integrates the Equipment Fragment with Animations Montages and support for Gameplay Events.
