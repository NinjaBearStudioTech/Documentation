    <p><b>Summary: Drop Ability</b></p>
    <br/>
    <ul>
        <li>Drops one or more items from the inventory into the world.</li>
        <li>Requires the item to include a <b>Drop Fragment</b> that defines how it should be instantiated or spawned.</li>
        <li>This ability is typically triggered via <b>payload activation</b> from user interfaces or game logic.</li>
    </ul>
</tldr>

The **Drop Ability** executes a **drop action** on one or more selected items, removing them from the inventory and
spawning them into the world. This is commonly used when players manually discard items via menus or drag-and-drop interfaces.

The Drop Ability is generally granted to characters by default and is triggered using <b>payload activation</b>:

- From user interface widgets (e.g., inventory menus).
- From other abilities or systems that wish to drop an item programmatically.

Since it relies on **context from the activation payload**, this ability is rarely activated manually by the player via 
hotkeys or direct bindings.

## Item Requirement

Only items that include a [**Drop Fragment**](inv_fragment_drop.md) are eligible to be dropped by this ability.

The fragment determines how the item will behave once droppedâ€”such as the actor class to spawn, position logic, or whether
physics simulation should be applied.
