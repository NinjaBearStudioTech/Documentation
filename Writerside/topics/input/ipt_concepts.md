# Concepts
<primary-label ref="input"/>

This section includes **high-level concepts** for the Input System. These elements are provided by an aggregation of
multiple technical elements, such as **components** and **gameplay classes**.

**[](ipt_input_management.md)**
: Ninja Input allows you to separate input handling code from your controllers and pawns by introducing **Input Handlers**. 
It also provides functionality to add or remove inputs as needed via the **Input Manager**.

**[](ipt_input_setup.md)**
: Once your Input Handlers are ready, they can be bundled with the pertinent Input Mapping Context, in an **Input Setup**
and then added to an Input Manager.
