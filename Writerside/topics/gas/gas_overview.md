![Ninja G.A.S.](gas_feature.png "Ninja G.A.S.")

The **Ninja G.A.S** plugin is designed to help with the boilerplate code necessary to get started with the **[Gameplay Ability System][1]**.

## Main Features

- **Gameplay Ability System Setup**: Covers the basic steps required to have the Ability System running.
- **Pawn and Player State**: It is common to have the ASC running on _Pawns_ or _Player States_. The system covers both scenarios.
- **AI Support**: Introduces G.A.S. elements to Behavior and State Trees.
- **Data-Driven Setup**: Attribute Sets, Gameplay Effects and Abilities are configured via Data Assets. 
- **Extended Functionality**: Includes other common extensions, such as Passive Abilities, Batch Activation and Lazy-Loading of the ASC.

## Design Pillars

- **Simplicity**: Allows you to use the Gameplay Ability System as fast as possible.
- **Common Practices**: Meant to incorporate popular practices and utilities for the ASC.

## Integrations

- A great starting point for **[Ninja Combat][3]** and **[Ninja Inventory][4]**. 
- **[Ninja Input][5]** can be used to integrate the **[Enhanced Input][2]** with the **[Gameplay Ability System][1]**.
