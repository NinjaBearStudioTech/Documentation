The **Ninja Interaction** plugin was designed to simplify streamline how interactions can be defined. It is build using
Smart Objects and Gameplay Behaviors and the Gameplay Ability System. 

It creates a unified design for interactions that can be used by both Player and AI characters, via the Interaction 
Ability, while also retaining the usual workflow for Smart Objects, if your project needs it.

## Main Features

- **Data-oriented Setup**: Built using **Smart Objects**, interactions are very easy to define, using Data Assets and usual Blueprints.
- **Gameplay Integration**: Multiple **gameplay modules** integrated to work together for both players and AI characters.
- **User Interface**: You can bind provided **viewmodels** to your user interface to track your interaction progress.
