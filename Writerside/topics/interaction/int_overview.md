The **Ninja Interaction** plugin streamlines the definition and execution of interactions by orchestrating core gameplay 
systems in the engine, including the **Gameplay Ability System**, **Smart Objects**, **Gameplay Behaviors**, and **State Trees**.

## Main Features

- **Very Flexible**: Use **state machines** to design simple and complex interaction flows for each interactable actor.
- **Behavior-Driven**: **Smart Objects** and **Gameplay Behaviors** define how each interaction works, including multiple interactions per target.
- **Player and AI**: Built on Smart Objects, allowing standardized interactions for both players and AI agents.
- **Extensible**: Interactions are triggered via Gameplay Abilities, making them compatible with other systems.
- **User Interface**: Bind the provided **ViewModel** to your UI to track interaction progress.
