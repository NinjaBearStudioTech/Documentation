# Interaction Target
<primary-label ref="interaction"/>

The **Interaction Target** is built on two frameworks: **Smart Objects** and **Gameplay Behaviors**. It introduces 
specialized logic and flows, integrated with other parts of the Interaction System.

## Smart Objects

Interaction Targets are built around the **Smart Objects** framework. It allows multiple possible interactions, that
are represented by **slots**. Each Interaction Target Component needs a **Smart Object Definition**.

Each slot may contain a list of **Gameplay Behaviors**, used to apply data and logic to each slot. The Interaction 
System provides a dedicated **Interaction Behavior** that orchestrates the Interaction Interface and Animations.

> **Slots and Supported Interactions**
> 
> Each interaction supported by an object is represented by a **dedicated slot**, containing the **Interaction Behavior**.
