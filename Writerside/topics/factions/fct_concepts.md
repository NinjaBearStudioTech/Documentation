# Concepts
<primary-label ref="factions"/>

This section includes **high-level concepts** for the Faction System. These elements are provided by an aggregation of
multiple technical elements, such as **components** and **gameplay classes**.

**[](fct_factions_memberships.md)**
: Factions and their respective Memberships are the core concept for this system. Once **Factions** are defined, actors
can become _members_ via a **Membership**.

**[](fct_reputation_tiers.md)**
: **Reputation** is an optional extension to the **Membership**. It allows members to progress their _standing_, which
moves them to higher membership **Tiers** within the Faction.
