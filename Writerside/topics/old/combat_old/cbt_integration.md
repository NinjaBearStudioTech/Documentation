# Integrations
<primary-label ref="combat"/>

Ninja Combat can be integrated with other plugins from Ninja Bear Studio to further enhance its capabilities. This 
section will walk you through the **possibilities** and **implementation**.

**[Ninja Factions](cbt_integration_factions.md)**
: The **[](fct_overview.md)** plugin can be used to automatically disable "friendly fire" between members 
of the same faction who have a friendly attitude toward each other.

**[Ninja Input](cbt_integration_input.md)**
: The **[](ipt_overview.md)** plugin can be used to properly trigger inputs in the way the Combat System 
expects, especially regarding the [Combo Manager](cbt_combos.md). Additionally, the Input Buffer is useful for certain setups.

**[](cbt_integration_inventory.md)**
: The **[](inv_overview.md)** plugin can replace the Weapon Manager, enabling the Combat System to
retrieve weapons directly from the [](inv_inventory_manager.md).
