# User Interface
<primary-label ref="inventory"/>

Stores information relevant to a **Widget** representing the item in the **User Interface**.

All text fields available in this fragment are **localized**, which means you can type a value directly in the field,or 
use a key from a **String Table** instead. 

> If you are using **String Tables**, you might need to **configure**, **gather** and **compile** your text in the 
> Engine's [**Localization Dashboard**][1].
