This page will walk you through the **pre-requisites** and **steps** necessary to enable the **Ninja Combat** plugin.

## Pre-Requisites

Before setting up the component, there are some pre-requisites to address.

First, ensure you have a working **Gameplay Ability System** setup:
1. Add the **Ability System Component** to your Pawn or Player State.
2. Properly implement the **Ability System Interface** on your base class.
3. Ensure that you can add **Attribute Sets**, **Gameplay Effects**, and **Gameplay Abilities**.
4. If you are using [](gas_overview.md), configure it first.

Next, make sure you have the **input** configured:
1. Your Player Character is ready to handle **Input Actions**.
2. If you are using [](ipt_overview.md), configure it first.

## Installing the Plugin

Once acquired, you can install the plugin via the **Epic Games Launcher**. Like any **code plugin**, it can be installed 
to any compatible engine version.

Once installed, create or open your project and navigate to **Edit** and then **Plugins**. In the search bar, type _Combat_ 
and the **Ninja Combat** plugin should appear. Tick the checkbox and restart the engine.

## C++ Modules

If you're working with C++ and using classes from the Combat System, ensure you add the following modules to your `Build.cs` file:

<tabs group="sample">
    <tab title="Build.cs">
        <code-block lang="c#" src="cbt_build.cs"/>
    </tab>
</tabs>

## Ability System

There are two steps to execute during the initial setup: **Configure the Ability System Globals** and adding the 
**Combat Attribute Set**. 

As you explore other pages, or the how-tos, you will learn about other GAS-related aspects that can be configured later
on.

### Ability System Globals

The Ability System must be configured to use the **Global Class** and the **Cue Manager** provided by the project, or
a **custom subclass** exclusive to your project.

Add the following settings to your `DefaultGame.ini`, located in the `Config` folder.

``` ini
[/Script/GameplayAbilities.AbilitySystemGlobals]
AbilitySystemGlobalsClassName="/Script/NinjaCombat.NinjaCombatAbilitySystemGlobals"
GlobalGameplayCueManagerClass="/Script/NinjaCombat.NinjaCombatGameplayCueManager"
```

### Combat Attribute Set

Add the `NinjaCombatAttributeSet` to your character's Ability System Component. You find the sample data to initialize
it in the appropriate Attribute Set reference page.

## Collision Channels

You may want to create dedicated trace channels for Melee Scans and Projectiles. One way of doing that, for example is by
adding the following lines to your `DefaultEngine.ini` file, located in your `Config` folder.

```ini
[/Script/Engine.CollisionProfile]
+DefaultChannelResponses=(Channel=ECC_GameTraceChannel1,DefaultResponse=ECR_Ignore,bTraceType=True,bStaticObject=False,Name="Weapon")
+DefaultChannelResponses=(Channel=ECC_GameTraceChannel2,DefaultResponse=ECR_Block,bTraceType=True,bStaticObject=True,Name="Projectile")
```

Here is a breakdown of these collision types, so you can make sure that actors will also react correctly to them:

1. The **Weapon** channel is used to trace weapon collisions during **Melee Attacks**.
2. The **Projectile** channel is used to detect impacts from **Projectile Impacts**.

> **Ignore or Block?**
> 
> You should consider if you want your melee and ranged attacks only interacting with possible targets, or with 
> everything else too, so you could do things like adding decals to walls after hitting them with a sword or fireball.
{style="note"}

> **Double-check your Game Trace Channels**
> 
> The Trace Channels from the sample above might already be in use for other purposes in your game. Double-check that
> they are not conflicting with anything else to avoid odd collision issues. 
> 
> Also make sure that you are not duplicating the Collision Profile category itself.
{style="warning"}

Finally, assign these Collision Channels in your Combat Settings: `Edit` > `Project Settings` > `Ninja Combat` 

![Initial Settings](cbt_setup_settings.png "Initial Settings")

## Combat Component

Your main Character class must have the **Combat Manager** component added to it, along with the appropriate **Combat
System Interface**. Make sure to return the **Combat Manager** from the `GetCombatManager` function.

> **How about the other Components and Functions?**
>
> You don't need to worry about other components or methods in this interface for now, except for the **Weapon Manager** 
> and **Movement Component**, both listed below. 
>
> For more information about the other components, and how to use these interface functions, check the 
> **[Extensions](cbt_component_extensions.md)** page.
{style="note"}

### Weapon Manager

Create the appropriate **[](cbt_weapon_architecture.md#weapon-manager)** and make sure to return it in the 
**Combat System Interface**. By default, you have **two options** available for the Weapon Manager type:

- **Default**: A basic Weapon Manager that can be used as-is for simpler scenarios.
- **Equipment**: This Weapon Manager is compatible with the **[Inventory System](inv_overview.md)**.

> **One step at a time**
> 
> Even if you plan to integrate with Ninja Inventory, consider starting with the **Default Weapon Manager**, so you 
> can make sure that your system works as expected, before introducing more layers to it.

### Movement Component

If you want to use the provided Combat **Character Movement Component**, make sure to override the default one in your
character, either in C++ or in your Blueprint.

You are not required to use this Movement Component in your project, and it is also fine to use a completely different
Movement Solution.

<tabs group="sample">
    <tab title="Blueprint">
        <img src="cbt_override_movement_component.png" alt="Override default input component" border-effect="line"/>
    </tab>
    <tab title="C++">
        <code-block lang="c++" src="cbt_override_movement_component.cpp"/>
    </tab>
</tabs>

## Migration: 1.0 to 2.0

Version 2.0 introduced many updates to the Combat System. It also drastically simplified the configuration. Itâ€™s easier to have a separate copy for the migration, so you can paste some contents over.

> **Back up first!** 
> 
>Before migrating to version 2.0, it is highly recommended that you back up your project!  
{style="warning"}

1. The combat components "Damage", "Defense" and "Target" were **merged** into the unified `NinjaCombatManagerComponent`. To get started with the new system, you only need to add that component and a `NinjaCombatWeaponManagerComponent`.
2. The `CombatSystemInterface` will try to find all components by their interfaces. Right away, you can just implement the getters for the Combat Manager and Weapon Manager. Other functions can be implemented if/when necessary.
3. The **Weapon Manager** was improved to be usable out-of-the-box. Review extensions that you made to this component, as they may no longer be needed.
4. The **Opportunity Manager** and all related components were removed from the system. Please check the new Opportunity System to learn how to configure Opportunity Attacks.
5. **Weapon Actors** have a default Scene Component, and already implement Melee and Projectile interfaces. They have many properties available to adjust their behaviors.
6. Functions for **Weapon Cosmetics**, from Melee and Ranged interfaces, had their signature changed. If you have custom implementations for these interfaces, review them accordingly.
7. In a C++ project, make sure to review your modules in the `Build.cs` file.
8. The **death flow** was reviewed to be more uniform across different sources of fatal damage. If you made changes to the original functions, you might need to review them.
9. The Poise and Stagger system was changed and Poise now decreases. This addresses an issue where characters would not react to damage in version 1.0 since their poise was always zero. Be sure to review your **Combat Attributes** using the new JSON reference.
10. The **Dissolve Handler** is more flexible, supporting multiple parameters and curves.
11. The **Forward Reference** can be any Scene Component, and it can be created automatically by the Combat Manager.
12. The Movement Manager has been converted into an actual Character Movement Component, so you will need to add that to your character, if you want to use the movement capabilities.
