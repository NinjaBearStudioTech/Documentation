![Ninja Bot](bot_feature.png "Ninja Bot")

Ninja Bot is an AI framework plugin for Unreal Engine that introduces a structured approach to **perception evaluation and 
awareness**. It is designed to sit between Unreal's AI Perception system and higher-level decision logic, providing a stable 
and reusable foundation for AI behavior.

The framework focuses on exposing interpreted, meaningful data to existing AI decision systems while remaining fully 
compatible with Unreal Engine and the Ninja plugin ecosystem.

## Main Features

- **Simplifies AI configuration** and promotes reusability.
- Introduces **explicit perception evaluation** and **awareness modeling**.
- Aggregates multiple senses into **normalized awareness data**.
- Exposes meaningful inputs to **Behavior Trees** and **State Trees**.
- Provides additional gameplay features such as **Patrol Points**.
- Provides a dedicated and optional module for **Threat Management**.
- Integrated with the User Interface, via base **UMG widgets** and **ViewModels**.
- Integrates seamlessly with [**Ninja Factions**][1].

## Architecture Overview

Ninja Bot is organized around a clear separation of responsibilities between **sensing, interpretation, decision support, 
and presentation**. Each layer is explicit, data-driven, and independently extensible.

At a high level, the data flow follows this sequence:

- **World Stimuli**: Raw events generated by gameplay systems, such as sight, sound, damage, and team context.
- **Sensing and Teams**: Detects stimuli and exposes perception and team data without interpretation or decision logic.
- **Ninja Bot**: Evaluates sensed data into normalized perception entries and interprets them into continuous awareness.
- **Decision Systems**: Consumes awareness data to drive AI behavior using Behavior Trees or State Trees. 
- **UI Presentation**: Observes awareness state and presents AI intent through ViewModels and widgets.
  
By separating sensing, interpretation, decision-making, and presentation, Ninja Bot enables AI behavior to be authored 
in a **fully data-driven and reusable way**. Multiple bots can **share the same AI controller** while differing only in 
their data assets, including **perception settings**, **awareness profiles** and optionally, [**faction configuration**][1]. 

This non-opinionated design supports both **Behavior Trees** and **State Trees** equally, allowing teams to choose the 
decision model that best fits their project while sharing the same perception and awareness backend.
