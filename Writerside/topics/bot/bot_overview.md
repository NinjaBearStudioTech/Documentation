Ninja Bot is an AI framework plugin for Unreal Engine that introduces a structured approach to **perception evaluation and 
awareness**. It is designed to sit between Unreal's AI Perception system and higher-level decision logic, providing a stable 
and reusable foundation for AI behavior.

The framework focuses on exposing interpreted, meaningful data to existing AI decision systems while remaining fully 
compatible with Unreal Engine and the Ninja plugin ecosystem.

## Main Features

- **Simplifies AI configuration** and promotes reusability.
- Introduces **explicit perception evaluation** and **awareness modeling**.
- Aggregates multiple senses into **normalized awareness data**.
- Exposes meaningful inputs to **Behavior Trees** and **State Trees**.
- Integrates seamlessly with [**Ninja Factions**](fct_overview.md).
