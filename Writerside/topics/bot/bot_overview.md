- **Features for AI Systems**: Additional services, evaluators, decorators and tasks for Behavior or State Trees.
- **AI Strategy**: A centralized AI manager based on the "AI Director" concept, built using the State Tree module.
- **Integrated with Ninja Factions**: Integrated with Ninja Factions, to determine AI attitude using Faction and Reputation.
